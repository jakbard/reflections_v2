What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	Merge compares the files and combines them by keeping the most logical updates by comparing the following inputs:
	1)	Original file, 
	2)	Copy of one branch
	3)	Copy of second branch

	Finally outputs one version of the updated file. Diagram helps understand what commits are accessible before and after the merge.
